------


Specifications are versioned according to semver, with one caveat: Once a specification breaks backwards compatibility, (ie, its Major version is increased ) it should be given a new specification document.

Specifications have their status and version state in the beginning of the document. Specifications that are in
draft should not a version number, and the first version used once they are finalized should be '1.0.0'
