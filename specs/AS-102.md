# AS-102: Bundled Transactions - JSON Format

Status: Draft

Version: -

## Abstract

This document describes the data format and directions for reading and writing bundled transactions.

## Motivation

Bundling multiple logical sub transactions into one full transactions provides a number of benefits:

1. To allow delegation of payment for a data transaction to a 3rd party, while maintaining the identity and      signature of person who created the transaction, without them needing to have a wallet with funds.

2. Increasing write throughput on the network by offloading the signature verification during writes to the gateway rather than the nodes.

3. Allow multiple logical transactions to be written as a group in one full transaction.

## Specification

### 1. Transaction Format

#### 1.1 Tags

A bundled transaction MUST have the following two tags present:

- `Bundled-Tx-Format` a string describing the bundling format. The format for this specification is `json`
- `Bundled-Tx-Version` a version string. The version referred to in this specification is `1.0.0`

#### 1.2 Transaction Body Format

This format for the transaction body is a JSON array of sub transactions:

```json
[
  { "sub_tx" },
  { "sub_tx" }
]
```

Every `{ "sub_tx" }` object is a JSON representation of a transaction, encoded and decoded in the exact same manner
as when using the the V1.0 HTTP API and the `/tx` to POST or GET a transaction. See: [http_iface_docs.md](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/blob/be1f3a8d47999b6ac4bb168c370346fc05cee76a/http_iface_docs.md)

It has the following restrictions:

1. `reward` MUST be set to an empty string.
2. `quantity` MUST be set to an empty string.
3. `last_tx` MUST be set to an empty string.
