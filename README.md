# Arweave Standards

This repository contains:

- Drafts and finalized specifications for data formats, tag formats, data protocols, custom gateway features or anything that is built on top of the Arweave Network and needs to be standardized.

- General best practices, for example, on how to format data, what already existing specifications should be re-used.

- How to approach building 2nd layer services such as custom gateways or other auxiliary services

- Discussions around these specifications, best practices and documents.
  
Anyone can contribute to this repository, either through discussion in the issues or submitting new drafts, specifications, best practices or documents.

To contribute, either start or comment in an issue for the related topic, or fork the repo and submit a PR to add a new document, or update an existing document.

## Guidelines for issues / discussions

Since this repo contains documents for many different subjects, issues should be prefixed with the
document they are discussing, for example a discussion around a specific aspect of AS-101 ( Gateway capabilities endpoint ) should be titled like: `"AS-101: Some Topic"` or `"AS-101: General"`. This applies to the AS documents and all other documents in this repository.

For issues regarding the repository itself, issues can be opened with no prefix.
