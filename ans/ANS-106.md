# ANS-106: Do-not-store Request

Status: Draft-1

Author: Abhav Kedia <abhav@arweave.org>

## Abstract

This document describes a transaction format that users of the Arweave newtork can use to request miners to not store certain kinds of data. In order to request removal, upload an empty data transaction with the transaction ID of the data you would like to remove, along with tags as specified here. Upon receiving this data, nodes of the network will independently decide whether or not to accept the request. 

## Motivation
The Arweave permanent storage protocol enables a truly permanent digital store of media and documents. 

There might be various reasons why persons or entities might wish to remove some data from the network. These include CESM, privacy, government regulation and copyright violation. By uploading a transaction that adheres to this standard, users of the network can ensure that their request is considered by nodes implementing the standard.  

## Specification

### Transaction Format

A Do-not-store Request transaction MUST be an empty data transaction with the following tags:

| Tag Name | _Optional?_ | Tag Value |
|---|---|---|
|App-Name|False|`Do-not-store Request`|
|Dont-Store|False|TXID|
|Category|True|`Category-Tag`|
|Reason|True|A text description of the reason for requesting removal|
|Geography|True|If requesting removal in particular countries, include the 2 letter `Country-Code` (Alpha-2, ISO 3166)|

### Category-Tags

Category tags are a short-hand way of specifying the reason for removal. Common tags include `CESM`, `Private`, `Regulation`, 'Copyright'. Custom category tags may be used as appropriate. Custom tags must not exceed 50 characters. 

## Future work
There may be a need to request removal based on various properties of data or tags associated with them. This standard may be extended to allow for lists of transactions and/or associated filtering criteria.
