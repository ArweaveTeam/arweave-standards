Status: Draft-1

Author: Abhav Kedia <abhav@arweave.org>

## Abstract

This document describes the format that users of the Arweave newtork can use to request miners to not store certain kinds of data. There might be various reasons why persons or entities might wish to remove some data from the network. These include CESM, privacy, government regulation and copyright violation. By uploading a transaction that adheres to this specification, users of the network can ensure that their request is considered by nodes implementing this standard.
