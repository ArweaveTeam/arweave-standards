# ANS-108: External Blockchain Data Owner

Authors: Jim Toth <jim@artby.city>

## Abstract

This standard outlines a mechanism for tagging data transactions to signal that the data owner means to publish this data for use on a blockchain external to the Arweave network.

## Motivation

The Arweave network has grown rapidly to be the primary immutable persistence layer of the permaweb.  As more Web3 use cases arise, multi-chain solutions, such as that of NFTs, are often implemented in such a way that obscures the Arweave blockchain from the true owner of the data being published.  Often, these data transactions are being published from platform or project specific utility wallets on behalf of the true data owners.  The primary transaction that ultimately pays for this data to be published may originate on a blockchain that is external to the Arweave network, such as Ethereum or Solana, by using a service such as Bundlr Network.

The ANS-104 Bundle Standard allows utility wallets to publish data transactions on behalf of other arweave wallets, but it is often too cumbersome for Web3 developers to create and handle unique Arweave wallet identities for each of their users that originate on external blockchains.

To address this, it is proposed that data transactions published to the Arweave network be tagged with a signature from the true data ownerâ€™s external blockchain wallet to signal this identity as the true data owner, or full co-owner of the published data.

## Specification

External Data Owner tags consist of three tags on data transactions.

| Tag Name | _Optional?_ | Tag Value |
| ---      | ---         | ---       |
|External-Network|false|The name of the external blockchain network e.g. `Ethereum`|
|External-Owner|false|The public external blockchain address of the true data owner|
|External-Owner-Signature|false|A signature of the transaction made by the external blockchain address|
