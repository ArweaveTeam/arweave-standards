# Versioning

In general, Semantic Version strings: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html should be used to version things such as data formats, data protocols, app versions.  

The advantage of Semantic Versioning is relevant for things when backwards compatibility is a concern, and for adding features or patching issues is useful to reflect in the version string.
